# Employee_Tracker

In this lessons challenge we were tasked with creating a Employee Tracker that keeps track of multiple departments, roles, employees and salaries.

One of the hardest tasks for me during this project was figuring out how to create a file structure that i could keep organized while also being able to bridge them all together.

Installation Tips:

input the schema and the seed files into MySQL Workbench then invoke "node app.js" from the root folder and enjoy the app!

Future Improvments:

Fixing / Adding the update functionality as well as options to delete ETC. Also having more criteria to search by would be great to implement as well.
